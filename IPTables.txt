
Firewall:
---------
> It is a system that is designed to prevent unauthorized access from 
entering a private network by filtering the information that comes in 
from the internet.

> It will block unwanted traffic and it permits only wanted traffic.

> It creates a safety barrier between a private n/w and public n/w.

> It is more important to the large organizations which has a lot of 
computers and servers.

> It stops harmful activity before it can spread into the other side of
the firewall and cause harm to the private network.

> It is essential in Business organizations to keep their network safe.

> It will work by filtering the incoming network data and determines by 
its rules if it is allowed into the network or not.

> Firewall rules are also known as "Access control list".

> These rules are cutomizable and determined by the network administrator.

> The administrator will decide what can enter into the network and what
can leave from the network.

> These rules either allows or denies permissions.

> Firewall rules can be based on IP addresses, domain names, protocols,
 programs, ports, keywords.

> Types of firewall:
	1. Host-based firewall: > It is a software firewall, that is installed
				on a computer and it protects that computer
				only. 
				> All latest versions of windows comes with
				a host-based firewall.
				> "Zone alarm" is a popular third-party
				host-based firewall.
				> A lot of antivirus programs comes with 
				a host-based firewall.

	2. Network-based firewall: > It is the combination of hardware & 
				software and it operates at the network 
				layer.
				> It places between private and public 
				network.
				> It will protects the entire network.
				> Stand-alone firewall, used by large org's.
				> Routers have built in firewall, used
				by small org's.
				> They can also be deployed on service
				providers cloud infrastructure.


IPTables:
----------
> It is standard firewall for linux systems such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Kali etc.

> It is a Linux firewall which is used to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.

> All data is sent in the form of packets over the internet.

> This is a command line application tool is used to manage the 
Linux firewall rules.

> Structure of IPTables: IPTables->Tables->Chains->Rules

> Each rule defines what to do with the packet (ACCEPT, DROP, RETURN)
	ACCEPT: Packet will be allowed.
	DROP:	Packet will be dropped.
	RETURN:	Skip the current rule and go back to the next rule from the chain.

> Each rule contains a criteria and a target.

> IPTables have 4 predefined tables:
	1. Filter table
	2. NAT table
	3. Mangle table
	4. Raw table

1. Filter table:
-----------------
> This table has the following built-in chains:
	a. INPUT: Used to filter the incoming packets. We can allow/block based on 
		port, protocol, IP address.
	b. OUTPUT: Used to filter the packets that are going out. 
	c. FORWARD: Used to filter the packets that are incoming but they are to 
			be forwarded somewhere else.

2. NAT table:
-------------
	a. PREROUTNG: Alter packets before routing. (Destination IP address)
	b. POSTROUTING: Alter packets after routing. (Source IP address)
	c. INPUT.
	c. OUTPUT.

3. Mangle table:
-----------------
	a. INPUT
	b. OUTPUT
	c. FORWARD
	d. PREROUTNG
	e. POSTROUTING

4. Raw table:
-------------
	a. PREROUTNG
	b. OUTPUT

> To install IPTables use:
	
	sudo apt-get install iptables

> To view the Filter table use:

	iptables -t filter --list	(or)	iptables --list

> To view the NAT table use:

	iptables -t nat --list

> To view the Mangle table use:

	iptables -t mangle --list

> To view the Raw table use:

	iptables -t raw --list

> If we don't specify the -t option, it will display the default filter table.

> To list all the rules use:

	sudo iptables -L

> If there are no rules, all packets will be transferred without filtering.

> Commonly used options in IPTables:
	1. -s: source address
	2. -d: destination address
	3. -p: protocol
	4. -j: action
	5. -P: Policy
	6. -A: Append/Add a rule at the end of a chain
	7. -D: Delete a rule from a chain
	8. -L: List all chain rules
	9. -F: Removes all rules from a chain

> To block any website use the following:

	1. To get ipaddress of a website: 
		
			dmitry becbapatla.ac.in

	2. To add a rule in IPtables:
		
			iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP -d 52.95.116.115

	3. To delete a rule:
			
			iptables -D OUTPUT -j DROP -d 52.95.116.115	
			iptables -D OUTPUT 3(Sq no)
			iptables -F

> To avoid ping scans from external source, we must avoid icmp conncetion

	iptables -A INPUT -j DROP -p icmp -i eth0

> To change the policy of a chain:
	
	iptables -P FORWARD DROP
