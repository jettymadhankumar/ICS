Cross site scripting:
---------------------
> It is also known as "XSS attack".

> It is a client-side attack.

> It is a secuity vulnerability found in web applications.

> It allows hackers to inject client-side script into web pages.

> And later if that web page is viewed by others, the stored scripts get
executed.

> Consequences may like displaying alert messages and stealing
 session cookies, session id's.

> This attack is found in web applications, where the user provides
input to an input receiving areas like search box, forms etc.

> If the user provides proper input, it will be processed by the web app.

> If the user provides java script code instead of providing the valid input,
if that is processed by the web application, then we can assume that
cross site scripting is happened on that web app.

> It is classified into2 types:
1. Reflected/Non-persistent cross site scripting
2. Stored/Persistent cross site scripting

> In Reflected scripting, the user input is not stored in the database.
The executed script(response from web app) is showned to the user only.

> In Stored scripting, the user input is stored in the database.

> For demonstration we are using "DVWA" in kali linux 2016.

> DVWA is a vulnerability web application, which is available in "github.com"

> Once the zip file is downloaded, extract it to the desktop and rename
it to "dvwa".

> Cut the extracted folder and paste it in "/var/www/html".

> Open a terminal, and change the default directory to "/var/www/html".

> Change the permissions as "chmod -R 775 dvwa"

> Start the apache tomcat service as "service apache2 start"

> Start the mysql service as "service mysql start"

> Login to the mysql as "mysql -u root -p"

> Press enter when it ask to enter password.

> Create a database in mysql as "create database dvwa".

> Open a browser and type the url "/localhost/dvwa".

> Open config file from "/var/www/html/dvwa/config" and remove the 
password field value and leave it as blank and save the file and remove
".dist" extension from its file name.

> Open a browser and type the url "/localhost/dvwa".

> Use the default credentials as "admin", "password".

> Scroll down and click on "Create database"

Examples:
---------
1. Low level security, <script>alert("Hi")</script>

2. Medium level security, <script>alert("Hi")</script>. It won't work,
check page source and it clearly indicates that opening tag of <script>
is removed. Try <scr<script>ipt>alert("Hi")</script>,
<SCRIPT>alert("Hi")</script>.

3. Impossible level security, <script>alert("Hi")</script>. It won't work,
with the help of regexp the character from <script> is replaced with an
empty string. Try <img src="x" onError=alert("Hi")/>
